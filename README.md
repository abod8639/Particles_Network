# particles_network

A highly optimized Flutter package that creates an interactive particle network effect with smooth animations and touch interactions. The package creates a visually appealing network of particles connected by lines that respond to touch input.

## Features

- üöÄ Highly optimized rendering using spatial partitioning
- üé® Customizable particle appearance (color, size, count)
- üîó Dynamic line connections between nearby particles
- üëÜ Interactive touch response with particle attraction
- üéØ Smooth particle movement with natural physics
- üì± Responsive to screen size changes for consistent layout across devices
- ‚ö° Memory-efficient with smart distance caching and compact typed arrays (e.g. Uint16List)
- üß† Optimized data structures: fast hashing, minimal allocations, reduced garbage

## Getting started

Add this package to your Flutter project by adding the following to your `pubspec.yaml`:

```yaml
dependencies:
  particles_network: ^1.5.5
```

## Usage

Here's a simple example of how to use the Particles Network widget:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:particles_network/particles_network.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(const MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  const MyApp({super.key});

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        backgroundColor: Colors.black,
        body: ParticleNetwork(
          touchActivation: true,         // to Activate touch
          particleCount: 80,            // Number of particles
          maxSpeed: 0.5,                // Maximum particle speed
          maxSize: 3.5,                 // Maximum particle size
          lineDistance: 200,            // Maximum distance for connecting lines
          particleColor: Colors.white,
          lineColor: const Color(0xFF4CFFA7),
          touchColor: Colors.amber,
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

```

## Customization

The `OptimizedParticleNetwork` widget accepts several parameters for customization:

 - `particleCount`: Number of particles in the system (default: 50).

   ‚ö†Ô∏è If `particleCount` exceeds 400, there may be a noticeable drop in performance,
   especially on low-end devices or when combined with large canvas sizes.
- `maxSpeed`: Maximum velocity of particles (default: 0.5)
- `maxSize`: Maximum size of particles (default: 3.5)
- `lineDistance`: Maximum distance for drawing connecting lines (default: 100)
- `particleColor`: Color of the particles (default: white)
- `lineColor`: Color of connecting lines between particles (default: teal)
- `touchColor`: Color of lines created by touch interaction (default: amber)

## Performance Optimization

The package uses several optimization techniques:

1. **Spatial Partitioning**: Divides the space into a grid to reduce particle distance calculations
2. **Distance Caching**: Caches distances between particles to avoid recalculations
3. **Efficient Repainting**: Only repaints when necessary using smart `shouldRepaint` checks
4. **Memory Management**: Clears caches each frame to prevent memory growth

## Additional Information

- Package is optimized for both mobile and web platforms
- Supports both light and dark themes
- Compatible with Flutter's widget tree and can be used in any container
- Automatically handles screen size changes and orientation changes
